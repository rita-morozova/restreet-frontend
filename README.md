# RE-STREET

## Description

Also, if someone knows an available  walls location, they can share it with the community by placing a pin on the map. Users can get some inspiration by contemplating modern art. Each piece of art has a color palette showing the colors used to make it. Users can create their own moodboard by liking paintings from the gallery page. Users can watch video lessons, create notes while watching lessons and create their own library with favorited videos.
